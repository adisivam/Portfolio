The term “life expectancy” refers to the number of years a person can expect to live. By definition, life expectancy is based on an estimate of the average age that members of a particular population group will be when they die. In this project, I aim to explore the parameters affecting the life span of individuals living in distinct countries and learn how the life span can be estimated with the help of machine learning models. I will also focus on exploring the parameters that greatly impact the lifespan of an individual

During covid-19 pandemic, the housing market has increased exponentially across the USA. Texas is one of the states which saw house prices skyrocket. Among various cities in Texas, I have chosen the house sale data available in and around Austin for this analysis. In this project, I explored the factors that contribute to increases in home prices.
